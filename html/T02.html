        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>
          In Basic Web, we were introduced to the fundamentals of web development as part of our study start assignment. This assignment focused on giving us a solid foundation in tools and techniques essential for creating responsive web designs.
          During this process, we learned about CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout design, as well as how to implement media queries to ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes. Additionally, we explored the use of typography (fonts), HTML
          structure (sections and divs), and styling basics, such as managing colors, margins, and padding. These core concepts were crucial for completing the assignment and developing our understanding of web design best practices.
        </p>

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
          After being provided with the project requirements and guidelines, we started coding the solution. This involved applying the techniques and principles we had learned to build a functional and visually appealing web layout. The final result
          is a website that demonstrates our ability to structure content effectively, design for responsiveness, and create an overall clean and modern aesthetic. You can see the final product displayed underneath.

        <h3>Learning</h3>
        <p>
          This project served as an introduction to essential tools like VS Code and Figma, helping us understand their features and how to use them efficiently in a professional workflow. • VS Code: We became familiar with writing and organizing
          HTML and CSS code, managing file structures, and using extensions to improve productivity. • Figma: We explored the basics of UI/UX design and learned how to create wireframes and prototypes that guided our coding process. Through this
          assignment, we gained a deeper understanding of web design principles, responsive layouts, and the importance of planning and design in the development process.
