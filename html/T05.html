        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>
          For our final project, we worked on creating a website for the restaurant Hanoi Alley. Our task was to design a site that captured the essence of the restaurant while also taking photos inside to showcase its atmosphere. Throughout the
          design process, we faced communication challenges within the group, which made it difficult to agree on a direction. Despite the obstacles, we remained committed and took the time to sit down as a team. After a thorough discussion, we
          reached a consensus on a design that everyone felt confident about moving forward with.

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
          We ultimately developed a website that effectively represented Hanoi Alley, highlighting its unique ambiance and culinary offerings. We incorporated high-quality images that we took in the restaurant to give the website a more authentic
          feel. By addressing our internal challenges and focusing on collaboration, we were able to complete the project successfully, ensuring that the final design met everyone's expectations.

        <h3>Learning</h3>
        <p>
          This project taught me the importance of clear communication and collaboration, especially when working within a group. We learned how to address disagreements constructively and keep the focus on the final goal. I also gained experience in
          integrating real-world photography into a website design, enhancing its visual appeal. Additionally, I refined my ability to navigate design challenges while maintaining a professional approach to problem-solving.
